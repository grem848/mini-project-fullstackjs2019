# miniProjectStartClassDemo

### This is the project we did together in the class with the following changes:

- Added changes to LocationBlogSchema.js as suggested by Thomas 
- Renamed makeUsers.js into makeData.js
- Added a small utility function to makeData.js to "test" the behaviour of likedBy. You should move this into a real test
- Added an incomplete userFacade.js and an empty blogFacade.js which both are for you to complete
- Added a test-folder with test-skeleton code in testUserFacade.js and an empty testBlogFacade. These must be completed by you
- If you run the tests (npm test) you should see two FAILING and two passing tests (remember to add your connection strings to settings.js)
- If you plan to use this for something serious (exam-demo, for example) make sure NOT to push your DB-credentials to GIT (an easy, but addmittet not the most elegant way, will be to git-ignore the settings.js file)
